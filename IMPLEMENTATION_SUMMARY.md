- **Periodic work scheduling** for maintenance tasks

### 8. Security Implementation
- **AES/GCM encryption** for note content
- **Secure key management** with SecurityKeyManager
- **Password hashing** with SHA-256
- **EncryptedSharedPreferences** for secure storage
- **Biometric authentication** support

### 9. Reports & Analytics
- **Comprehensive statistics**:
  - Total notes count
  - Pinned notes percentage
  - Encrypted notes percentage
  - Recent vs regular notes breakdown
  - Trash statistics with expiration warnings
- **Visual progress bars** for statistics
- **Real-time updates** via LiveData
- **Export/Import functionality** with JSON format

### 10. Advanced Features
- **QuickPreviewDialog**: Modal dialog for note preview
- **SwipeHelper**: Custom ItemTouchHelper for swipe gestures
- **ExportImportManager**: Handles backup and restore operations
- **Multi-language support** (Turkish/English)
- **Accessibility features** with proper content descriptions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

3. ‚úÖ Lock/Unlock ‚Üí correct icon shown
4. ‚úÖ Delete multiple notes ‚Üí moved to Trash, not lost
5. ‚úÖ Trash auto-clears notes after 30 days
6. ‚úÖ Restore from Trash ‚Üí note returns to Notes
7. ‚úÖ Trash count updates in Reports
8. ‚úÖ Navigate to Trash ‚Üí no crashes
